* callsign is callsign of skimmer
* ttt is the time out in seconds for when considering a skimmer 
  (or a band for a skimmer) inactive.
* sss is the number of spots since the last update
* ppp is the number of seconds since the last update
* eee is time of the update in second epoch.
* www is a weighted skew in ppm across active bands. 
  Number has two decimals and sign when negative. Period as decimal separator. 
  null if no spots on any band within the last ttt seconds. 
* nnn is the skew for a particular band. 
  Number has two decimals and sign when negative. Period as decimal separator. 
  null if no spots on band in question within the last ttt seconds. 
* A skimmer inactive on all bands ("skew":null) is only reported once and 
  will not reported again until active again.

SKEW_TEST_REF {"time":eee,"ref_count":dd,"ref_call":["call1","call2",...]}

* eee is time of the update in second-based epoch.
* dd is number of active reference skimmers. 
* call# is callsign of reference skimmmers.
